# 18 Chord Organ

Chord Organ for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer. Replicates the behaviour of the standalone Chord-Organ module: 16 chords, up to 8 voices per chord, 1V/oct root control, and glide.

## Controls

| Input | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Main knob** | Chord selection (0–15). Summed with CV 1. |
| **CV 1** | Chord CV (0V to +5V): added to Main knob for voltage-controlled chord selection. Negative voltages ignored. |
| **X knob** | Root transpose (semitones). |
| **Y knob** | Progression pattern selection (0–8). |
| **CV 2** | Root note (1V/oct). |
| **Audio 1** | VCA control: 0V to +5V controls output volume (0% to 100%). Full volume when disconnected. |
| **Pulse 1** | Trigger: advances progression step and retriggers chord/reset pulse. |
| **Pulse 2** | Cycle waveform (sine → triangle → square → saw) on each trigger. |
| **Switch Up** | Enable glide (portamento). |
| **Switch Middle** | Disable glide. |
| **Switch Down** | Cycle waveform (sine → triangle → square → saw). |

## Outputs

| Output | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Audio 1 & 2** | Mixed chord (same on both). |
| **CV 1** | Highest note in current chord (1V/oct, calibrated). |
| **CV 2** | Sequenced root note from selected progression (1V/oct, calibrated). |
| **Pulse 1** | Brief pulse on chord or root change (or Pulse 1 in rising edge). |
| **LEDs 0–3** | Chord index in binary (0–15). |
| **LED 4** | Reset indicator (on while reset pulse is high). |
| **LED 5** | Waveform index (brightness). |

7. Suspended 4th  
8. Power 5th

13. Augmented  
14. Root
15. Sub octave
16. 2 up 1 down octaves

## Progression Patterns

The chord progression sequencer outputs root notes via CV Out 2. Select patterns with Knob Y, advance steps with Pulse In 1.

0. **I-IV-V-I** - Classic pop/rock progression (C-F-G-C)
1. **I-V-vi-IV** - Popular progression (C-G-Am-F)
2. **ii-V-I** - Jazz turnaround (Dm-G-C)
3. **I-vi-IV-V** - 50s progression (C-Am-F-G)
4. **I-IV-I-V** - Blues progression (C-F-C-G)
5. **vi-IV-I-V** - Sensitive progression (Am-F-C-G)
6. **I-bVII-IV-I** - Mixolydian (C-Bb-F-C)
7. **Chromatic** - Ascending chromatic scale (C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G)
8. **Circle of 5ths** - Circle of fifths sequence (C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#)

**Note:** Root offsets are relative to the current root (CV In 2 + Knob X). Chord type is still controlled manually via Main Knob.

## Build

Requires Pico SDK and (optionally) `PICO_SDK_PATH` set.

**Toolchain:** Arm GCC **15.x** can fail with `cannot find -lg` when linking the Pico SDK boot stage. Use one of:

- **Arm GNU Toolchain 10.3-2021.10** (discontinued embedded): https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads — pick **arm-none-eabi** for your OS; includes `libg.a`.
- **Arm GNU Toolchain 13.2 or 14.2** from the main downloads page (older releases) — these usually still ship the expected newlib layout.

Install one of the above, put its `bin` directory first in your `PATH`, then build.

```bash
cd 18_chord_organ
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Copy `chord_organ.uf2` to the Workshop Computer when in bootloader mode.

## Firmware

- **Platform:** Pico SDK (C++), ComputerCard
- **Sample rate:** 48 kHz
- **Features:** Glide (50 ms), 4 waveforms, 9 progression patterns
